    "Wordle is a popular word guessing game. Here are the rules of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "The game begins with a randomly selected five-letter word. The player must guess the word within ten attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each guess, the player will receive feedback in the form of a list of integers of length 5, containing either 0,1, or 2 (eg [0,0,1,2,1] or [1,1,2,0,1])\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ith integer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "0, then the ith letter of the guess is not present in the word\n",
    "1, then the ith letter of the guess is correctly positioned\n",
    "2, then the ith letter of the guess is present in the word but is misplaced.\n",
    "The player can use this feedback to refine their guesses and work towards solving the word. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or uses up all ten attempts.\n",
    "The game runs the algorithm for 10 different words and prints out your guesses and whether you got the correct answer."
